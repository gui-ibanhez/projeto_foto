# Example: ALLOWED_HOSTS=192.168.1.10, my-server.local
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost, 127.0.0.1

# --- Database ---
# The default is a local SQLite file, which is fine for your use case.
# No changes are needed if you are using SQLite.
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
# For PostgreSQL, you would use something like:
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname

# --- Production Security (for private LAN) ---
# These settings are disabled for a simple, non-HTTPS LAN server.
